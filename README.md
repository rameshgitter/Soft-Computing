ANNOUNCEMENT - For Assignment 2

This is to inform all students seeking clarification regarding Question 2 of Assignment 2. For performing the Max-Min Composition or Max-Product Composition, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Compute the Fuzzy Relation R (C x D): Start by calculating the fuzzy relation R using the two given fuzzy sets: "Cold" and "Warm."

2. Perform the Fuzzy Set Composition: Conduct the Fuzzy Set Composition operation between the fuzzy sets ("Cold" and "Warm") and the relation R computed in the first step:
   - C o (C x D)
   - D o (C x D)

3. Output and Visualization: Display the resulting two outputs and plot the corresponding graphs for visualization.

Please be sure to follow these steps accurately to complete the assignment successfully.
